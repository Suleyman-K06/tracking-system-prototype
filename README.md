<h1>Installation & Setup</h1>

Because the node_modules folder is excluded to keep the repository clean, you must install the dependencies locally:

<ol>
  
1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js installed.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project root and run: npm install

3. **Run the Server:** Start the backend by running:
npm run dev

4. **View the Interface:** Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8383 or other designated port.
</ol>
